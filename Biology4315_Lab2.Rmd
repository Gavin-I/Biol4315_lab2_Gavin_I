# Section One:More Packages (ggplot2 and vegan)

Start by loading the vegan and ggplot2 packages
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library('vegan')
library('ggplot2')
```

Next, we will put the dune dataet into a variable called dune2 and log1p transform it
```{r}
data(dune)
dune2 = dune
log1p(dune2)
```

Now, we will perform nmds on dune2 using the function metaMDS
and assign it to a new variable. 
We will then access the points and assign it to dpoints
```{r}
new_dune2 = metaMDS(dune2)
dpoints = new_dune2['points']

```
